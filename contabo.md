As a DevOps engineer working with Contabo for web hosting, along with database management, here are tasks you can perform:

### 1. **Server Setup and Configuration**
   - Spin up and configure cloud instances (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) for hosting PHP applications.
   - Install and configure a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to serve PHP-based web applications.
   - Set up firewalls, security groups, and access control (e.g., SSH keys) for secure access.

### 2. **Database Setup and Management**
   - Install and configure databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) on your Contabo server.
   - Create databases and manage users with appropriate permissions.
   - Back up and restore databases as needed using tools like `mysqldump`.

### 3. **Application Deployment**
   - Deploy PHP applications to your web server.
   - Set up virtual hosts in Apache or Nginx to manage multiple domains.
   - Manage environment variables and configuration settings for your PHP application.

### 4. **SSL Certificate Management**
   - Configure SSL certificates for secure HTTPS connections (e.g., using Let's Encrypt).
   - Set up automatic certificate renewal using Certbot.

### 5. **DNS Configuration**
   - Manage DNS records (A, CNAME, MX) to point domain names to your Contabo server's IP.
   - Ensure proper configuration for email delivery and subdomains.

### 6. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track server performance, resource usage, and uptime.
   - Configure log management for your web server and application using tools like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Logrotate.

### 7. **Security and Firewall Management**
   - Set up firewalls (e.g., UFW) to restrict access to certain ports and services.
   - Configure fail2ban or other intrusion prevention tools to guard against attacks like brute force attempts.
   - Regularly update server packages to ensure security patches are applied.

### 8. **Load Balancing and Scaling**
   - Set up load balancers for distributing traffic across multiple servers.
   - Implement horizontal scaling by adding new instances based on traffic demands.

### 9. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**
   - Configure automated backups of your server files, databases, and configuration.
   - Implement disaster recovery procedures, such as creating snapshots of your server instances.

### 10. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Bitbucket Pipelines, or other tools to automate deployments.
   - Push Docker images from your CI/CD pipeline to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Nexus) and deploy on Contabo.

### 11. **PHP Application Optimization**
   - Configure caching mechanisms (e.g., Memcached, Redis) to improve performance.
   - Optimize the PHP runtime by adjusting `php.ini` settings (e.g., memory limits, execution times).
   - Monitor PHP performance with tools like Xdebug or New Relic.

### 12. **Networking Configuration**
   - Set up static routing or VPNs to ensure secure communication between servers.
   - Configure IP whitelisting for certain services or databases to restrict access.

### 13. **Managing Cron Jobs**
   - Set up cron jobs for scheduled tasks, such as running scripts, cleaning temporary files, or sending emails.
   - Monitor cron job execution and logs for troubleshooting.

### 14. **Database Performance Tuning**
   - Optimize database queries, set up indexing, and fine-tune database settings for performance.
   - Monitor database health and resolve performance bottlenecks.

These tasks will help you efficiently manage your web hosting and database environments using Contabo, integrating with other tools such as Bitbucket and Jira.
