   - **Branch Management:** Create, delete, and manage branches for feature development, bug fixes, and releases.
   - **Merge Requests:** Handle pull requests (merge requests) to review, approve, and merge code changes from feature branches to main branches.

### 2. **Version Control**
   - **Commit Changes:** Commit code changes with descriptive messages and track the history of changes.
   - **Tag Releases:** Create tags for marking specific releases or versions of your project.

   - **Collaborate with Team:** Communicate with team members through comments and discussions on pull requests and commits.

### 4. **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**
   - **Set Up Pipelines:** Configure Bitbucket Pipelines or integrate with external CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins) to automate builds, tests, and deployments.
   - **Monitor Build Status:** Track the status of your builds and deployments directly within Bitbucket.

### 5. **Branch Strategy and Merging**
   - **Implement Branching Strategies:** Follow strategies like Git Flow or trunk-based development to manage code changes effectively.
   - **Resolve Merge Conflicts:** Handle and resolve conflicts that arise during the merging process.

### 6. **Access Control and Permissions**
   - **Manage Access:** Set repository permissions to control who can view, commit, or manage the repository.
   - **Invite Collaborators:** Add or remove team members and configure their access levels.

### 7. **Code Quality and Security**
   - **Integrate Code Quality Tools:** Connect with tools like SonarQube for code quality analysis and vulnerability scanning.
   - **Monitor Code Quality Reports:** Review reports and address issues related to code quality and security.

### 8. **Automated Testing**
   - **Run Tests:** Configure and run automated tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code changes do not introduce bugs.
   - **Review Test Results:** Analyze test results and address any failed tests or issues.

### 9. **Documentation and Wiki**
   - **Maintain Documentation:** Use Bitbucketâ€™s wiki or README files to document project setup, usage, and best practices.
   - **Update Documentation:** Keep documentation updated with new features, changes, and project guidelines.

### 10. **Repository Settings and Configuration**
   - **Configure Webhooks:** Set up webhooks to trigger actions in other tools (e.g., sending notifications to Slack or triggering builds).
   - **Manage Repository Settings:** Configure repository settings such as branch permissions, merge strategies, and default reviewers.

### 11. **Integration with Issue Tracking**
   - **Link Jira Issues:** Integrate Bitbucket with Jira to link commits and pull requests to specific Jira issues or tasks.
   - **Reference Issues in Commits:** Use Jira issue keys in commit messages to automatically update issue statuses and track progress.

### 12. **Backup and Restore**
   - **Backup Repositories:** Ensure regular backups of repositories to prevent data loss.
   - **Restore Repositories:** Restore repositories from backups if necessary.

These tasks will help you manage your source code effectively using Bitbucket, ensuring smooth collaboration and integration with other tools like Jira and Contabo.
